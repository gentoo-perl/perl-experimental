  MooseX-Emulate-Class-Accessor-Fast-0.00700.ebuild,
  MooseX-Emulate-Class-Accessor-Fast-0.00701.ebuild,
  MooseX-Emulate-Class-Accessor-Fast-0.00800.ebuild:
  Blocked on Class-MOP >0.78 Reason being in that version it added a WARN
  because this module uses a deprecated function, and that warn became a
  cluck in 0.80 which breaks a thing or two during make test. Better
  versions added.
