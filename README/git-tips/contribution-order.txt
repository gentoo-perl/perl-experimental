Recommended Contribution Order
==============================

Contributions are recommended to be performed in the following order:

  1. Progress your patch sequence locally.
  2. *(optional)* push your patch sequence to your personal public repository
  3. Push your patch sequence to xref:repositories-github[Github].
  4. Push your patch sequence to xref:repositories-gogo[git.overlays.gentoo.org].

This order will hopefully reduce the amount of push collisions encountered,
which will make all our lives easier =).

[TIP]
It is strongly suggested to watch xref:networks-irc[`#gentoo-perl`] for pushed commit notices so
you can anticipate a collison happening _before_ it occurs outside the safety
of your pc

[TIP]
If `git` tells you there is an upstream non-fast forward merge, do make sure
you resolve it locally somehow, not just force it, unless you _know_ what you
are doing.

[TIP]
For optimal continuity, it is suggested you do all you can possible to
linearize commits. See link:linearize_commits.txt[Linearizing Commits]
